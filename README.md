# va-framework v2

`main` now tracks the React-native rewrite of the visual analytics framework.
The stable Vue release is preserved on the `release/v1.0.0` branch.

## Current milestone

The codebase is being rebuilt as a modular workspace for web-based visual analytics:

- `v2.0.0`: React shell and monorepo baseline
- `v2.1.0`: data foundation with shared contracts, coordinated state, and local/remote execution
- `v2.2.0`: single-view analytics
- `v2.3.0`: graph data
- `v2.4.0`: spatio-temporal data
- `v2.5.0`: multi-view coordination
- `v2.6.0`: spatial-ready foundations

## Workspace layout

- `apps/web`: Next.js App Router frontend
- `apps/api`: FastAPI backend
- `packages/ui`: shadcn-style component baseline
- `packages/contracts`: shared TypeScript contracts and schemas
- `packages/view-system`: workspace and view contracts
- `packages/vis-core`: visualization primitives

## Development

This repo now uses `pnpm` workspaces for the JavaScript side and Python 3.11+ for the API.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:web
pnpm dev:api
```

Or run both app processes together:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The frontend runs at <http://localhost:3000>.
The backend health endpoint is available at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health>.
